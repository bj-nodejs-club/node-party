### Tuts+ Tutorial: Building an Instagram Based Portfolio With Bootstrap
#### Instructor: Steve Everett

In this tutorial I am going to run through the process of creating the simple Instagram based portfolio as seen in [this previous tutorial](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/designing-a-simple-instagram-based-portfolio-in-photoshop--cms-21402) by Thomas.

Thomas has done a great job keeping the design simple, spacious and functional so I think it's only fair we do the same when building it. To make our lives easier we are going to rely on a few tools and libraries which I will cover in the next section.
